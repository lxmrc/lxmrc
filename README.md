Hi, Iâ€™m Alex.

Iâ€™m a self-taught developer based in Melbourne, Australia. Iâ€™m interested in :
  - Ruby, whether on Rails or regular
  - Back-end development in particular
  - Linux, Docker, CI/CD, devops, all that stuff
  - Why learning is hard and how to do it better
 
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

### Rumblr
A Tumblr-like microblogging application written in Ruby on Rails. <br/>

### Hyperbolic
As in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hyperbolic+time+chamber">"time chamber"</a>. Currently just an in-browser editor that can execute code on the server-side in containers. Eventually a platform for practicing programming using [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) through "executable flashcards".<br/>
